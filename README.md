# PSSS

The Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (DOE JGI) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) are collaborating to sponsor a team at the BioIT hackathon in Boston on May 15-16.  Participants will use available tools (PebbleScout and SourMash) to identify reads of interest in SRA and then further explore them by examining metadata and BLAST pre-assembled contigs to obtain alignments and annotate the results.
